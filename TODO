Better trace_t structure
------------------------

#define TNODE_SIZE 1ULL << 8
    
typedef struct tnode_t
{
  instr_t *instr[TNODE_SIZE];
  struct tnode_t *next;
} tnode_t;
    
It should reduce the number of calls to malloc() and the size of the whole
structure in memory. We first fill the array with NULL (search for the last
non empty element is performed by dichotomic search).

But, a lot of the API for trace_t must be slightly adapted.
